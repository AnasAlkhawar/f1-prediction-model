# Formula 1 Prediction Model (R)

An R-based project that explores historical Formula 1 data (lap times, pit stops, qualifying, race results, standings) to analyze trends and generate predictive comparisons.

## Project Structure
- `Data/` – F1 datasets (circuits, drivers, races, lapTimes, pitStops, results, etc.)
- `src/` – R source code for data prep, analysis, and prediction logic
- `Output/` – generated outputs (plots/results)

## How to Run
1. Open `f1data.Rproj` in RStudio
2. Install required packages (tidyverse, etc.)
3. Run: `src/f1_prediction_model.R`

## Outputs
Example results and comparisons are saved in the `Output/` folder.
